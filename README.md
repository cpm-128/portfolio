# Colleen Maher: Portfolio

## Portfolio basics include:
- name
- photo/avatar
- navigation links to:
    - about
    - work
    - contact

## Site Functionality Requirements
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

    - NOTE: in screenshots, the header is not captured correctly due to screen scrolling with the camera extension. See actual header/hero image match-up here:
